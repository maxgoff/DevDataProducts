### Cousera Project: Developing Data Products

This repo contains the code and refined datasets developed to meet course requirements for Coursera's Developing Data Products (Johns Hopkins) course.  The application is based on data from the National UFO Reporting Center.  The dataset was obtained by scraping their collection of public web pages and tyding the data for processing and visualization.

The project involved creating a shiny application: [shinyapps.io](https://maxgoff.shinyapps.io/DevDataProducts) and a 5-slide online presentation:[rpubs.com](http://rpubs.com/maxgoff/UFO_Explorer)
