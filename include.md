### Welcome to the UFO Sightings Database Explorer
Author:  [Max K. Goff](http://about.me/maxgoff)

This application was developed as the course project for [Courera's Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod) course.

The application is based on data from the [National UFO Reporting Center](http://www.nuforc.org).  The dataset was obtained by scraping their collection of public web pages and tidying the data for processing and visualization.

Source code for this application is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/maxgoff/DevDataProducts).

The user can adjust the date range on the side panel to change the three visualization tabs: Time Series, By Shape, and By Hour of Day.  The filtered datasets can be viewed on the tables tabs: Time Series Data and All Data.

For this study, the SHAPES of UFOs were summarized from the raw data based on the following arbitrary classifications:

<table style="width:100%;table, th, td {border:1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse}">
<tr><th>ASHAPE</th><th>LSHAPE</th><th>OSHAPE</th><th>RSHAPE</th><th>USHAPE</th></tr>
<tr><td>chevron</td><td>changed</td><td>unknown</td><td>circle</td><td>cigar</td></tr>
<tr><td>cone</td><td>changing</td><td>other</td><td>crescent</td><td>cylinder</td></tr>
<tr><td>cross</td><td>flash</td><td>  </td><td>dome</td><td>disk</td></tr>
<tr><td>delta</td><td>fireball</td><td> </td><td>egg</td><td>  </td></tr>
